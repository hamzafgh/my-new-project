## Background

this idea is so fun to let people know the probability of their favourite player winning the award in any time at the saeson compared to other players and since the fanbase of this sport is so large i think it will be useful 

## How is it used?

the user will give me as an input the statistics of a player and the model will give him the probability of winning

## Data sources and AI methods
the data can be collected easily from the past ballon d or winners
## Challenges

there are some problem like the world cup in example is played once in 4 years and others competitions like the euro
to solve that i think i will ask the user to give me wich year and based in the competitions that will be on the year it will give the perfect outputs
## What next?

if people enjoy it we can make an ai model for every award in every sport
